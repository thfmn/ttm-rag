# Current State

This section describes the current state of our project, including what we've accomplished and what's working.

## Accomplishments

So far, we've successfully completed the following:

1. **Project Structure**: Set up a well-organized project structure following best practices
2. **Dependencies**: Configured project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
3. **Documentation**: Created this Sphinx-based documentation
4. **Core Models**: Implemented basic data models (Source, Document)
5. **PubMed Connector**: Created a working connector for the PubMed API
6. **PubMed Pipeline**: Implemented a pipeline that uses the connector to fetch and process data
7. **Testing**: Developed comprehensive unit and integration tests
8. **Main Script**: Created a demonstration script that shows the pipeline in action
9. **Structured Data Parsing**: Enhanced the PubMed connector to parse XML data into structured information using Pydantic models
10. **Sophisticated Search Queries**: Implemented advanced search query building capabilities for Thai Traditional Medicine research

## What's Working

Our implementation is successfully:

1. **Connecting to PubMed API**: Our connector can successfully communicate with the PubMed API
2. **Searching for Articles**: We can search for articles using keywords
3. **Fetching Article Details**: We can retrieve detailed information for specific articles
4. **Processing Data**: Our pipeline can process the fetched data into our internal Document format
5. **Error Handling**: Our code gracefully handles network errors and API issues
6. **Testing**: All our unit and integration tests are passing
7. **Structured Data Parsing**: Our connector now parses XML into structured Pydantic models with proper validation
8. **Advanced Search Queries**: We can construct complex, sophisticated search queries tailored for Thai Traditional Medicine research

## Demonstration

When we run our main script, we get output like this:

```
Running PubMed pipeline with different query approaches...

1. Basic query: 'traditional medicine'
Found 3 documents

2. Thai Traditional Medicine query using query builder

3. Specialized Thai Traditional Medicine query function

4. Query with date range filter
Found 3 articles with date range query: (thai medicine) AND 2020/01/01:2023/12/31[Date - Publication]
  Article 1: Generalized lichen amyloidosis in a pregnant woman...
  Article 2: The beneficial effects of traditional Thai massage...
  Article 3: Dentists' Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A R...
```

This shows that our pipeline successfully:

1. Searches PubMed for articles related to "traditional medicine"
2. Fetches the first 3 articles
3. Parses the XML data into structured Pydantic models
4. Processes them into Document objects with rich metadata
5. Demonstrates advanced query building capabilities including:
   - Complex query construction with multiple terms
   - Exclusion of unwanted terms
   - Article type filtering
   - Date range filtering
   - Specialized query functions for Thai Traditional Medicine

## Code Quality

We've maintained good code quality practices:

1. **Modularity**: Code is organized into separate modules with clear responsibilities
2. **Documentation**: Classes and methods are documented with docstrings
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout the codebase
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
6. **Type Safety**: Using Pydantic models for type-safe data parsing and validation
7. **Fluent Interface**: Using builder pattern for query construction

## Limitations

Our current implementation has some limitations:

1. **Limited Sources**: We've only implemented PubMed integration so far
2. **No Database**: We're not yet storing data in a database
3. **No Validation**: We don't yet have data validation pipelines
4. **No Advanced Features**: Features like rate limiting, caching, or advanced search are not yet implemented

## Next Steps

In the next phase of development, we plan to:

1. Implement connectors for other data sources
2. Set up database integration for storing fetched documents
3. Implement data validation pipelines
4. Add more sophisticated error handling and logging
5. Implement rate limiting to respect API guidelines
