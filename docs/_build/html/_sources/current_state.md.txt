# Current State

This section describes the current state of our project, including what we've accomplished and what's working.

## Accomplishments

So far, we've successfully completed the following:

1. **Project Structure**: Set up a well-organized project structure following best practices
2. **Dependencies**: Configured project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
3. **Documentation**: Created this Sphinx-based documentation
4. **Core Models**: Implemented basic data models (Source, Document)
5. **PubMed Connector**: Created a working connector for the PubMed API
6. **PubMed Pipeline**: Implemented a pipeline that uses the connector to fetch and process data
7. **Testing**: Developed comprehensive unit and integration tests
8. **Main Script**: Created a demonstration script that shows the pipeline in action

## What's Working

Our implementation is successfully:

1. **Connecting to PubMed API**: Our connector can successfully communicate with the PubMed API
2. **Searching for Articles**: We can search for articles using keywords
3. **Fetching Article Details**: We can retrieve detailed information for specific articles
4. **Processing Data**: Our pipeline can process the fetched data into our internal Document format
5. **Error Handling**: Our code gracefully handles network errors and API issues
6. **Testing**: All our unit and integration tests are passing

## Demonstration

When we run our main script, we get output like this:

```
Running PubMed pipeline...
Found 5 documents
Document 1:
  PMID: 40874354
  Content length: 46286 characters

Document 2:
  PMID: 40874316
  Content length: 46286 characters

Document 3:
  PMID: 40874239
  Content length: 46286 characters

Document 4:
  PMID: 40874238
  Content length: 46286 characters

Document 5:
  PMID: 40874215
  Content length: 46286 characters
```

This shows that our pipeline successfully:

1. Searches PubMed for articles related to "traditional medicine"
2. Fetches the first 5 articles
3. Processes them into Document objects
4. Displays basic information about each document

## Code Quality

We've maintained good code quality practices:

1. **Modularity**: Code is organized into separate modules with clear responsibilities
2. **Documentation**: Classes and methods are documented with docstrings
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout the codebase
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage

## Limitations

Our current implementation has some limitations:

1. **Data Processing**: We're currently storing raw XML data rather than parsing it into structured information
2. **Limited Sources**: We've only implemented PubMed integration so far
3. **No Database**: We're not yet storing data in a database
4. **No Validation**: We don't yet have data validation pipelines
5. **No Advanced Features**: Features like rate limiting, caching, or advanced search are not yet implemented

## Next Steps

In the next phase of development, we plan to:

1. Enhance the PubMed connector to parse XML data into structured information
2. Implement connectors for other data sources
3. Set up database integration for storing fetched documents
4. Implement data validation pipelines
5. Add more sophisticated error handling and logging
6. Implement rate limiting to respect API guidelines
