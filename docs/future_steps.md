# Future Steps

This section outlines our plans for future development of the project.

## Short-term Goals

In the immediate future, we plan to focus on enhancing our current implementation:

### 1. Enhanced PubMed Connector
- ~~Parse XML data returned by the PubMed API into structured data~~ (Completed)
- ~~Extract specific fields like title, abstract, authors, publication date~~ (Completed)
- ~~Handle different XML formats that PubMed might return~~ (Completed)

### 2. Sophisticated Search Queries
- ~~Implement more complex search queries specific to Thai Traditional Medicine~~ (Completed)
- ~~Add filtering options (date ranges, article types, etc.)~~ (Completed)
- ~~Implement search query optimization~~ (Completed)

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Add more comprehensive error handling and logging
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Add more detailed error messages for debugging

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting to respect PubMed's API guidelines
- Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming the API
- Implement request queuing for better resource management

## Medium-term Goals

After completing the short-term goals, we'll focus on expanding our data sources and capabilities:

### 1. Additional Data Sources
- Implement connectors for other Tier 1 sources:
  - DTAM Database
  - PMC Open Access
  - Thai Traditional Medicine Journal
- Implement connectors for Tier 2 sources:
  - Thai University Repositories
  - WHO SEARO Reports
  - ASEAN Health Database

### 2. Database Integration
- Set up PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
- Implement data models based on our schema design
- Add functionality to save fetched documents to the database
- Implement database connection pooling for better performance

### 3. Data Validation
- Implement data validation pipelines
- Add quality scoring for documents
- Implement deduplication mechanisms
- Add data cleaning and normalization

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Implement comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus
- Set up Grafana dashboards for real-time metrics
- Add structured logging for better debugging
- Implement alerting for critical issues

## Long-term Goals

For the long-term success of the project, we have these goals:

### 1. Full RAG Implementation
- Implement vector embeddings for documents
- Set up OpenSearch for efficient searching
- Implement the retrieval component of the RAG system
- Implement the generation component using Typhoon models

### 2. Advanced Features
- Implement natural language querying
- Add document summarization capabilities
- Implement relationship mapping between documents
- Add recommendation systems for related documents

### 3. Scalability
- Implement distributed processing using Celery
- Add horizontal scaling capabilities
- Implement caching mechanisms for better performance
- Optimize database queries for large datasets

### 4. User Interface
- Develop a web interface for the RAG bot
- Implement an API for external integrations
- Add administrative interface for managing sources and documents
- Create documentation and examples for users

## Success Metrics

We'll measure our progress using these success metrics:

### Data Acquisition Metrics
- **Coverage**: 10,000+ validated TTM documents/articles
- **Source Diversity**: 50+ unique authoritative sources
- **Quality Score**: 95%+ data validation rate
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: <24hr automated processing time
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of processes documented

### System Performance Metrics
- **Pipeline Throughput**: Documents processed per hour
- **Storage Efficiency**: Database size vs document count
- **API Response Times**: Average response time by source
- **System Uptime**: Pipeline availability percentage
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and storage usage
