# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Thai Traditional Medicine RAG Bot project! This documentation will guide you through our project from conception to implementation, testing, and future plans.

## What is this project about?

This project aims to build a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot for Thai Traditional Medicine (TTM) knowledge. The bot will be able to answer questions about TTM by retrieving relevant information from a comprehensive database of TTM documents and generating human-readable responses.

## Why is this important?

Thai Traditional Medicine is a rich field of knowledge that has been passed down through generations. However, much of this knowledge exists in academic papers, government databases, and other hard-to-access sources. By creating a RAG bot, we can make this knowledge more accessible to researchers, practitioners, and the general public.

## Who is this documentation for?

This documentation is designed for:

- Team members working on the project
- Stakeholders interested in the project's progress
- Developers who want to understand the implementation
- Anyone interested in learning about the project
